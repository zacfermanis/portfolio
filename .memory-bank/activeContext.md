# Active Context: Portfolio Development

## Current Work Focus
**Initializing Memory Bank and Project Setup**

The portfolio project is in the early initialization phase. We're establishing the foundational documentation and preparing for the technical implementation.

## Recent Changes
- Created core memory bank files:
  - `projectBrief.md` - Foundation document defining project scope
  - `productContext.md` - Product vision and user experience goals
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development setup
  - `activeContext.md` - This file tracking current state

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Create `progress.md` to track what works and what's left to build
   - Review and validate all memory bank files with user

2. **Project Setup Phase**
   - Set up Next.js with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Create initial project structure

3. **Core Development**
   - Implement layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation)
   - Create section components (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
   - Build reusable UI components
   - Implement responsive design

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Next.js** as the React framework for static site generation
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **TDD Approach** following the development guide requirements
- **Component-Driven Architecture** for maintainability

### Pending Decisions
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel vs Netlify (leaning toward Vercel for Next.js integration)
- **Content Management**: Static content vs CMS integration
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics vs privacy-focused alternatives
- **Domain**: Custom domain setup and configuration

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: All code written in response to failing tests
- **Behavior-Driven Testing**: Focus on user interactions, not implementation
- **Component Reusability**: Create reusable, testable components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage, no `any` types
- **Immutable Data**: No direct mutations, functional programming approach

### Design Patterns
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights
- The project has a strong foundation with the development guide emphasizing TDD
- Portfolio projects benefit from clear content structure and fast loading
- Professional appearance is crucial for career advancement
- Accessibility and performance are not optional - they're core requirements

### Project-Specific Learnings
- The memory bank approach will be crucial for maintaining context across development sessions
- The portfolio needs to balance professional presentation with technical demonstration
- Content strategy will be as important as technical implementation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Initialization and Setup
- **Progress**: Memory bank documentation complete, ready for technical setup
- **Blockers**: None currently
- **Dependencies**: User validation of memory bank content before proceeding

## Immediate Actions Required
1. User review and approval of memory bank files
2. Decision on deployment platform preference
3. Confirmation of technical stack choices
4. Content gathering for portfolio sections
