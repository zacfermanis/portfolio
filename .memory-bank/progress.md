## Next Actions
1. **Immediate**: User validation of memory bank content
2. **Short-term**: Technical project setup and configuration
3. **Medium-term**: Core component development
4. **Long-term**: Content creation and deployment

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Technical implementation (well-defined stack)
- **Medium Risk**: Content creation (requires user input and time)
- **Low Risk**: Deployment (standard Next.js deployment process)
- **Medium Risk**: Performance optimization (requires ongoing monitoring)
