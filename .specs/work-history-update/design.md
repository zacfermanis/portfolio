# Work History Update Design

## Overview
Design specification for updating the work history section in CV details to accurately reflect the current resume and professional experience.

## Architecture

### Data Model Updates
The work history data structure remains the same, but the content will be updated to match the current resume:

```typescript
interface WorkExperienceEntry {
  yearRange: string
  company: string
  location: string
  title: string
  description: string[]
  technologies: string[]
}
```

## Components

### No New Components Required
This update only involves data changes to the existing `WorkHistorySection` component. No new components need to be created.

### Existing Component Updates
- **WorkHistorySection**: Will automatically display updated data from the portfolio data file
- **CVDetails**: No changes required - will continue to use existing structure

## Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[portfolio.ts] --> B[CVDetails Component]
    B --> C[WorkHistorySection Component]
    C --> D[Work History Display]
    
    A1[Updated workExperience data] --> A
    A1 --> E[Remove outdated entries]
    A1 --> F[Update locations]
    A1 --> G[Verify accuracy]
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Validation
1. Review current resume against existing work history data
2. Identify entries to remove (Fidelity, State Street, Bank of America, Wachovia)
3. Verify correct company names, titles, and dates
4. Confirm accurate locations for each role

### Phase 2: Data Update
1. Update `src/data/portfolio.ts` with corrected work history
2. Remove outdated entries
3. Update location information
4. Verify data structure integrity

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Test CV details expansion/collapse functionality
2. Verify all entries display correctly
3. Confirm responsive design still works
4. Test accessibility features

## Error Handling

### Data Integrity
- Ensure all required fields are present for each work history entry
- Validate date ranges are logical and don't overlap
- Verify company names and locations are accurate

### Fallback Scenarios
- If work history data is missing, display appropriate message
- Maintain existing error handling for malformed data
- Preserve graceful degradation for missing entries

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test WorkHistorySection with updated data
- Verify all entries render correctly
- Test empty state handling
- Validate responsive behavior

### Integration Testing
- Test CV details expansion with updated work history
- Verify smooth animations still work
- Test accessibility features with new content

### Manual Testing
- Verify all entries match current resume
- Confirm locations are accurate
- Test on different screen sizes
- Validate professional presentation

## Performance Considerations

### No Performance Impact
- This update only involves data changes
- No new components or complex logic added
- Existing performance characteristics maintained
- No additional network requests or processing

## Accessibility

### Maintain Existing Accessibility
- All existing ARIA labels remain valid
- Keyboard navigation unchanged

- Focus management continues to work

## Security

### No Security Implications
- This update only involves display data

- No authentication or authorization changes
- No data transmission modifications

## Deployment Considerations

### Simple Data Update
