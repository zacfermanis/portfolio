- AND the slider SHALL have a range from 0.1 to 1.0 opacity
- AND the default value SHALL be the current opacity
- AND changes SHALL be applied immediately

### 8. Background Ripple Effect Toggle

**As a** user in the particle controls modal  
**I want** to enable or disable the mouse ripple effect  
**So that** I can control whether mouse movement affects the particles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the user toggles the ripple effect checkbox
- THEN the mouse movement SHALL or SHALL NOT create ripple effects in the particles
- AND the checkbox SHALL be enabled by default (current behavior)
- AND changes SHALL be applied immediately

### 9. Particle Colors Control
