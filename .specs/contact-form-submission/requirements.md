# Contact Form Submission Requirements

## Feature Overview
Implement functional contact form submission using Resend email service to send emails to zacfermanis@gmail.com with proper subject prefixing and error handling.

## User Stories

### US-1: Contact Form Submission
**As a** website visitor  
**I want to** submit a contact form with my name, email, subject, and message  
**So that** I can reach out to Zac Fermanis for professional inquiries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a user fills out all required fields (name, email, subject, message) AND clicks "Send Message"  
  THEN the system SHALL validate the form data AND send an email via Resend API  
  AND display a success message to the user  
  AND clear the form fields

- WHEN a user submits the form with missing required fields  
  THEN the system SHALL display validation errors for each missing field  
  AND prevent form submission

- WHEN a user enters an invalid email format  
  THEN the system SHALL display an email validation error  
  AND prevent form submission

- WHEN the form submission is in progress  
  THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with "Sending..." text  
  AND disable the submit button

- WHEN the email is successfully sent  
  THEN the system SHALL display a success message  
  AND clear all form fields  
  AND reset any validation errors

- WHEN the email sending fails  
  THEN the system SHALL display an error message  
  AND keep the form data intact for the user to retry

### US-2: Email Formatting
**As a** recipient (Zac Fermanis)  
**I want to** receive properly formatted contact form emails  
**So that** I can easily identify and respond to inquiries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a contact form is submitted  
  THEN the email SHALL be sent to zacfermanis@gmail.com  
  AND the subject line SHALL be prefixed with "[ZF.COM] - " followed by the user's subject  
  AND the email body SHALL include the sender's name, email, and message

- WHEN an email is received  
  THEN the email SHALL be clearly identifiable as coming from the portfolio website  
  AND contain all necessary information to respond to the inquiry

### US-3: Environment Configuration
**As a** developer  
**I want to** configure the email service for different environments  
**So that** the contact form works in both development and production

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the application runs in development  
  THEN the system SHALL use RESEND_API_KEY from .env.local file

- WHEN the application runs in production  
  THEN the system SHALL use RESEND_API_KEY from Vercel environment variables

- WHEN the API key is missing or invalid  
  THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully  
  AND display an appropriate error message to the user

### US-4: Security and Validation
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** ensure the contact form is secure and protected  
**So that** the system is not vulnerable to spam or abuse

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN form data is submitted  
  THEN the system SHALL sanitize all input fields  
  AND validate email format  
  AND prevent XSS attacks

- WHEN the form is submitted  
  THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent spam  
  AND log submission attempts for monitoring
