- [x] 14. Add CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [x] 15. Integrate email service with API route
- [x] 16. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] 17. Add proper HTTP status codes and response formatting

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- [x] 18. Update `src/components/sections/Contact.tsx` to use real API endpoint
- [x] 19. Replace mock submission logic with actual API call to `/api/contact`

- [x] 21. Add network error handling and retry logic
- [x] 22. Implement rate limiting feedback in UI
- [x] 23. Update loading states to reflect actual API call duration
- [x] 24. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for API request/response

### Phase 5: Validation and Error Handling

- [x] 26. Implement proper error message display for different error types
- [x] 27. Add form field sanitization before submission
- [x] 28. Implement XSS prevention in form inputs
- [x] 29. Add email format validation on both client and server side

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [x] 30. Test API route with valid form data
- [x] 31. Test API route with invalid/missing data
- [x] 32. Test email delivery to zacfermanis@gmail.com
- [x] 33. Test rate limiting functionality
- [x] 34. Test error scenarios (network failure, invalid API key, etc.)
- [x] 35. Verify environment variable configuration
- [x] 36. Test form submission with various email formats
- [x] 37. Validate email subject prefix "[ZF.COM] - " is working correctly

### Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup
- [x] 38. Update memory bank with contact form implementation details
- [x] 39. Document environment variable requirements for deployment
- [x] 40. Add comments to complex validation logic
- [x] 41. Verify all TypeScript types are properly defined
- [x] 42. Ensure no console errors or warnings in development

## Task Dependencies

- Tasks 1-4 must be completed before Phase 2
- Tasks 5-9 must be completed before Phase 3
- Tasks 10-17 must be completed before Phase 4
- Tasks 18-24 can be completed after Phase 3
- Tasks 25-29 can be completed in parallel with Phase 4
- Tasks 30-37 require all previous phases to be complete
- Tasks 38-42 are final cleanup and documentation
