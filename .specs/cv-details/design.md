## Data Models

### Education Entry
```typescript
interface EducationEntry {
  degree: string;
  institution: string;
  location: string;
  yearRange: string;
}
```

### Work Experience Entry
```typescript
interface WorkExperienceEntry {
  yearRange: string;
  company: string;
  location: string;
  title: string;
  description: string[];
  technologies: string[];
}
```

### Skill Category
```typescript
interface SkillCategory {
  name: string;
  skills: string[];
}
```

## Styling & Animation

### Animation Strategy
- **Panel Expansion**: CSS height transition with `ease-in-out` timing
- **Content Fade**: Opacity transition with slight delay
- **Button Icon**: CSS transform rotation for chevron
- **Duration**: 300ms for smooth but responsive feel

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layout for skills
- **Tablet**: Adjusted column counts
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with proper spacing

### Color Scheme
- Inherit existing portfolio color palette
- Use subtle backgrounds for section differentiation
- Maintain accessibility contrast ratios

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if resume data is unavailable
- Loading states for dynamic content
- Error boundaries for component failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering with different states
- Button click handlers
- Animation triggers
- Accessibility attributes

### Integration Tests
- Panel expansion/collapse behavior
- Content rendering accuracy
- Responsive layout behavior

### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA label accuracy
- Focus management

## Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for expandable content
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order
- **Screen Reader**: Descriptive content for assistive technologies
- **High Contrast**: Maintained contrast ratios

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Skills section loads on expansion
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Efficient state management
- **Optimized Images**: If any icons are added

## Integration Points

### Existing Components
- Extend `About.tsx` component
- Use existing `Button` component styling
- Follow established typography patterns
- Maintain layout consistency

### Data Source
- Static data from resume analysis
- No external API calls required
- Easy to update content

## Future Enhancements

- **Print Styles**: Optimized printing of CV details
- **Export Options**: PDF generation capability
- **Interactive Timeline**: Clickable work history entries
- **Skill Filtering**: Category-based skill filtering
- **Dark Mode**: Theme-aware styling
